### Hi there, I'm Sonia.

I am a software engineer with 9+ years of experience (2024), working with several technologies. Although I am a generalist, most of my knowledge relies on systems design and architecture, distributed systems, backend development and related fields.

Currently, I am interested in:

- 🎮 Game development
- ⚙️ Systems architecture
